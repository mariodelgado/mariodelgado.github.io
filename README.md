Documentation for Mobile Web Extensions

<p>Mobile Web Extensions (MWE) are a set of frameworks selected by the Mosaic team to help our clients build consistent and content-rich web pages that serve as an extention to the currently native modules that are currently offered on the Mosaic Platform. A MWE is best used in cases where the data is more static than dynamic (news feeds, etc.)</p>

What is a MWE Capable of?

<p>Through a series of web frameworks selected by the Mosaic team for their mobile-friendly capabilities, broad community support, and long-term sustainability. The samples provided by the are designed for clients that may not have the development resources nor have near-future plans to create mobile-friendly sites. </p>

<p>A sample &#8216;module&#8217; consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>a &#8216;home page&#8217;</li>
<li>a sample menu structure</li>
<li>examples of sub pages</li>
</ul>

<p>What frameworks are used in the samples?</p>

<p>[[Bootstrap]], an open-source, mobile-first framework maintained by a few employees at Twitter, is a rapidly growing framework supported by all modern smartphones and desktop browsers. Bootstrap is currently at release 3.0 and provides a consistent and responsive platform for presenting your content on the website, with simple tools that allow you to quickly layout your content and user interface elements. </p>

<p>[[jQuery]] is a very popular open-source Javascript library that runs on top of (and plays well with) the Bootstrap framework. It is currently used by 65% of the top 10,000 websites. jQuery can be used in cases that require actions to be performed to the site or the site&#8217;s data, i.e. Forms and Searching.</p>

<p>[[Fontawesome]] is a set of over 350 free scalable vector icons that allow you to add quick graphics to your website, and include a full set of commonly used social media icons for your use. </p>

<p>These frameworks are loaded into the sample documents by linking out to a Content Delivery Network, or CDN. These </p>

<p>The sample also includes a suggested menu structure, which is built using [[Pushy]], a plugin for Bootstrap/jQuery, [[normalize]], a CSS plugin, and [[modernizr]], a JS plugin. </p>

<p>Making the sample content your own!</p>

<p>Feel free to use any text editor (we love SubEthaEdit or Brackets) to edit the files. </p>
