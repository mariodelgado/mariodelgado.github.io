### OpenPaths Map

I've been using [OpenPaths](https://openpaths.cc/) to track my movements during my Code for America fellowship year. This is a proof-of-concept, browser-based map to display this data to my specifications. I've been inspired by OpenPaths' own map (click "View My Map" on your data page), but want more control than is offered there.

### Setup

Because this is still only a proof of concept, a JSON export of your OpenPaths data is required. Click "JSON" under "Download my data" on your OpenPaths data page, and save it as "openpaths.json" in the same directory as index.html. In the future, data should be pulled directly from the OpenPaths API.
