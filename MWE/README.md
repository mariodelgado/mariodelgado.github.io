#Documentation for Mobile Web Extensions


<p>Mobile Web Extensions (MWE) are a set of frameworks selected by the Mosaic team to help our clients build consistent and content-rich web pages that serve as an extention to the currently native modules that are currently offered on the Mosaic Platform. A MWE is best used in cases where the data is more static than dynamic (news feeds, etc.)</p>

What is a MWE Capable of?
===


<p>Through a series of web frameworks selected by the Mosaic team for their mobile-friendly capabilities, broad community support, and long-term sustainability. The samples provided by the are designed for clients that may not have the development resources nor have near-future plans to create mobile-friendly sites. </p>

<p>A sample &#8216;module&#8217; consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li>a &#8216;home page&#8217;</li>
<li>a sample menu structure</li>
<li>examples of sub pages</li>
</ul>

The advantages of using a MWE is a starter version of a single codebase that, when deployed, will be able to render information properly on any mobile device. To make this possible, we ask that you try to adhere to the grid http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid layout methodology used by the bootstrap framework. 


What frameworks are used in the samples?

Bootstrap 3.0 / jQuery 1.10.1 / Fontawesome 3.2.1 / normalize.css 2.1.3 / modernizr 2.6.2 

[Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com), an open-source, mobile-first framework maintained by a few employees at Twitter, is a rapidly growing framework supported by all modern smartphones and desktop browsers. Bootstrap is currently at release 3.0 and provides a consistent and responsive platform for presenting your content on the website, with simple tools that allow you to quickly layout your content and user interface elements.

<p>[jQuery](jquery.org) is a very popular open-source Javascript library that runs on top of (and plays well with) the Bootstrap framework. It is currently used by 65% of the top 10,000 websites. jQuery can be used in cases that require actions to be performed to the site or the site&#8217;s data, i.e. Forms and Searching.</p>

<p>[Fontawesome](fontawesome.io) is a set of over 350 free scalable vector icons that allow you to add quick graphics to your website, and include a full set of commonly used social media icons for your use. </p>

<p>These frameworks are loaded into the sample documents by linking out to a Content Delivery Network, or CDN. These </p>

<p>The sample also includes a suggested menu structure, which is built using [Pushy](https://github.com/christophery/pushy), a plugin for Bootstrap/jQuery, [[normalize]], a CSS plugin, and [modernizr](modernizr.com), a JS plugin. </p>

#Making the sample content your own!

<p>Feel free to use any text editor (we love [SubEthaEdit](http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/) or [Brackets](brakets.io)) to edit the files. </p>

Implementation
===



<p>To get this site up and running, copy the entire folder to your server, and add a link to the directory on your Mosaic Springboard. </p>

Resources
===


<p>Though we do not directly provide support for MWE, we specifically chose our frameworks for their excellent community base. Here is a partial listing of great resources that will be helpful as you build new pages:</p>

<p>[Bootstrap form generator](http://minikomi.github.io/Bootstrap-Form-Builder/) - a drag-and-drop interface for
[Bootsnipp](http://bootsnipp.com/snipps) - code snippets of common interface patterns
[Bootsrap Documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/) - great resource highlighting all the possible UI patterns available out-of-the-box</p>
