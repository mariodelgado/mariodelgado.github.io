<h8>Note for All Applicants: 
If credentials are not issued in English, then a certified English translation along with the original language credential is required. If it is a copy of an original, the copy must be attested by an appropriate educational official within the home country.  If it is a copy the applicant is required to produce original educational credentials upon enrollment. See approved Attestation policy. If presented with a GENERAL TRAINING IELTS, it cannot be accepted for language waiver, and if no ACADEMIC IELTS or TOEFL provided, this will result in taking at least one term in the Intensive English Language Program (IELP). ​
